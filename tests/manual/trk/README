Run ./run.sh  in one terminal.
Run ./welsh-gdb or ./symbianelf-gdb in a second terminal.
Note that welsh-gdb does not handle 'set remote noack-packet on'

The following items "work":

- "stop" at E32Main
- manual relocation on the gdb side using
  add-symbol-file filebrowseapp.sym 0x786A4000
- disassembly at stopped location
- p <functionname>
- p $pc
- one level of 'bt'

To do:

- figure out why the result of the qOffsets query is not honoured
  _or_ how to have gdb doing the relocation automatically
- setting breakpoints by filename:line
- signaling of stopped/single step end. SIGTRAP? SIGSTOP?
- run it against the red brick
